Make .env and add the following line
`TOKEN=<discord bot api token>`

Make a normal bot using discord's application interface and give the bot the "bot" scope with the "read message history" permission.

To use the bot, invite it normally, then add its role to the channels that you want to moderate. 
Make sure to enable "manage messages" on the channels that you add the bot to.

TODO: Find a more elegant way of doing the above without having to add the role like that, it feels janky.
